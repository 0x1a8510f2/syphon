# Syphon FAQ

## How do I...

### ...Verify my session?

The option to manually/non-interactively verify sessions has been "hidden" in recent Element client releases.

In order to cross-sign/verify your Syphon session, with the Element client:

1. Open any chat you're in - though to make your life easier the smaller the better
1. Click the ![](images/info.png) button in the top-right to show room information
1. Click ![](images/people.png)
1. Click on your name (if you're in a large room, you may have to search)
1. Click on the untrusted session ![](images/syphon_not_trusted.png)
1. Click "Manually Verify By Text" ![](images/verify.png)

n.b. Interactive cross-signing is roadmapped as part of the `0.3.0` release

### ...Get Notifications?

Notifications are currently **Android-Only**.
  
Like most features in Syphon, notifications are disabled by default.

### ...Send Read Receipts?

Like most features in Syphon, Read Receipts are disabled by default and must be enabled in the Settings.

# Sypho
A privacy centric matrix messenger for everyone

## Why

## Todo
- SVG Icons
- Finish .env selection
- Loader screen with animations

## Before Hitting The Code
- Urls are always referencing matrix mxc:// protocol resources. Though they're actually URIs, they are referenced as URLs in the app to be consistant with the protocol spec

## Architecture

### Storage
There are three layers to storage in Syphon:
- Remote (Matrix Homeserver)
- Cache (Redux + Redux Persist +  Hive)
    * cache is encrypted at rest
- Cold Storage (Hive

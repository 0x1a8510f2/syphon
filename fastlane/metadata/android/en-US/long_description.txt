Syphon is a privacy centric matrix chat client.

Please be aware Syphon is still in Open Alpha.

Syphon aims to be built on the foundations of privacy, branding, and user experience 
in an effort to pull others away from proprietary chat clients to the matrix protocol.

Syphono will always be a not for profit, community driven application.

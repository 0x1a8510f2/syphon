# How To Add Translations

- Add a file under the prefix of a language code under the assets/translations directory
- Copy over all the language keys from another language you're familiar with ("title-intro": "Welcome to {}", etc)
- Replace only the contents of each key that do not contain special characters ("title-intro": "Bienvenido a {}",)
- Submit a PR with the title "<Language> Translations" for review

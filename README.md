# Tether

A privacy centric messenger for the people

## Why


## Todo
- SVG Icons
- Finish .env selection
- Loader screen with animations

## From Scatch

Another reason this project was so important was the ability to go from zero to usable open-source cross-platform app as soon as possible. The more accessible a platform is, the easier it is for people to create alternatives to tools that may be prohibited, discouraged, or just daunting.

# Syphon

A privacy centric messenger for everyone

## Why
A goal for syphon outside the concept itself was the ability to go from zero to usable open-source cross-platform app as soon as possible. The more accessible a platform is, the easier it is for people to create alternatives to tools that may be prohibited, discouraged, or just daunting. 

## Architecture

### Storage
There are three layers to storage in Syphon:
- Remote (Matrix Homeserver)
- Cache (Redux + Redux Persist +  Hive)
    * cache is encrypted at rest
- Cold Storage (Hive)
